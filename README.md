## James Harper tech test

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run server` will run the API at `http://localhost:8000`
- `npm run start` will run the React app at `http://localhost:3000`

### Notes
- I wasn't able to replicate some of the icons exactly so I used the closest font-awesome icons I could find.
- The emoji flags I was using in the language selector weren't displaying correctly for me, so I commented them out.
- I just used 768px (Ipad) as the breakpoint for the responsive layout changes for simplicity.
